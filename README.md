Tasks are serialized into Kafka topics , enabling parallel processing across multiple brokers. Kafka’s fault-tolerant design ensures no tasks are lost, even during failures.
Exactly-once semantics guarantee that tasks are processed without duplication, even during retries.
**Scalability :**
Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes ensures the system can handle increasing workloads by provisioning additional servers.
Vertical scaling allocates more CPU or memory to existing servers based on demand, ensuring efficient resource usage.
**Monitoring and Observability :**
Real-time monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana provides deep insights into system performance, including task queue lengths, server health, and Kafka metrics.
Distributed tracing with Jaeger/Zipkin helps diagnose latency issues and optimize task flow.
**Fault Tolerance and Recovery :**
Tasks are replicated across shards using Raft consensus , ensuring data consistency even during server failures.
Periodic checkpointing in distributed databases like Cassandra or Redis allows tasks to resume from their last state after recovery.

## Workflow

### Task Submission

#### Client-to-Server Communication
- **Clients submit tasks** to the system using **gRPC with Protocol Buffers** for efficient serialization.
- Each task includes:
  - Priority level (e.g., high, medium, low).
  - Metadata (e.g., estimated execution time, dependencies, deadlines).
- **Error Handling**:
  - Use standard gRPC error codes (`NOT_FOUND`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`) to handle issues during task submission.
- **Reverse Proxy**:
  - Use **NGINX** or **HAProxy** to distribute client requests across multiple server instances.
  - Implement load balancing strategies like **sticky sessions** or **round-robin** for efficient request routing.
- **WebSocket Support**:
  - Integrate WebSocket support via the proxy for real-time task status updates or bi-directional communication.
- **Distributed Tracing**:
  - Instrument the gRPC layer with **OpenTelemetry** to generate trace spans for each task submission.
  - Use sampling strategies (e.g., head-based or tail-based sampling) to manage trace data volume during high-load periods.

### Task Sharding and Replication

#### Dynamic Sharding
- Tasks are distributed across logical shards based on:
  - Priority level.
  - Client-specific metadata.
  - Predicted server load (using the **LSTM model**).
- **Load-Aware Sharding**:
  - Introduce adaptive sharding to dynamically resize shards based on historical processing times or task sizes (e.g., batch vs. individual tasks).
- **Consistent Hashing**:
  - Minimize disruption during shard redistribution.
  - Use adaptive sharding strategies if the system experiences frequent load changes.
- **Replication with Raft**:
  - Use **Raft consensus** to ensure fault tolerance and data consistency.
  - Optimize Raft performance by tuning:
    - Heartbeat intervals.
    - Election timeouts.
    - Log replication parameters.
- **Metrics Collection**:
  - Monitor shard distribution, replication lag, and task queue lengths using **Prometheus**.

### Task Prioritization and Heap Management

- **Min-Heap Implementation**:
  - Each shard maintains a **min-heap (priority queue)** of tasks, ordered by priority.
  - High-priority tasks (e.g., urgent deadlines) are placed at the top for fast processing.
- **Heap Resizing**:
  - Ensure efficient heap resizing under high loads to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- **Thread-Safe Operations**:
  - Use fine-grained locking or lock-free data structures for minimal contention.
  - Consider concurrent heaps or atomic operations for heap updates.
- **Distributed Tracing**:
  - Monitor heap operation delays (e.g., insertion, extraction) to diagnose performance issues related to task prioritization.
